5. Project Users Stories : 

It was one week sprint to build prototype for Lockme.Com


Sprint (1 week)

1. As a dev I want build registration page to enter user in system.

2. As a dev I want login page to authenticate a user to access lockme app.

3. As a user I want add locker system so that I can keep password safe.

4. As a user I want search so that I can find my credential fast.

5. As a user I want to delete so that I can remove my old credential.

6. As a dev I want to create iteration till user want so that user don’t have to      login again and again.


The achieve rate for the sprint was 100%.
We were able to complete all the user stories.
We have tested all the edge cases.

But after all we all are human, we make mistake. No product in this world is bug free
